Events can be useful if you need to listen out for when certain things in your application happen.

Simple Commerce provides a couple of events to help make your life easier.

## Listening for events

First, you'll need a Listener class. You can generate one by running `php artisan make:listener NameOfListener`. It'll generate a file in `App\Listeners`.

In the `handle` function of your event listener, that's where you write your logic that you need to happen when a certain event is triggered.

```php
class NameOfListener
{
    public function handle(NameOfEvent $event)
    {
        //
    }
}
```

Before your listener will actually listen to an event, you need to hook it up. You can do this in your `EventServiceProvider`, located in `App\Providers`.

```php
protected $listen = [
	NameOfEvent::class => [
    	NameOfListener::class,
    ],
];
```

And there you go, you have a listener listening to an event!

For more documentation around events and event listeners, consider reading [the Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/events).
